            On Android 36 the IME exit animation seems to be linked to the windowAnimationStyle.
            If we do not set it, the ime just disappears instantly.
            However, the windowExitAnimation seems to be applied to the IME as well, creating a ghosting effect.
            To remove the ghosting, we set an animation with alpha 0 and some duration
