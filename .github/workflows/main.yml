              ‚ùå Tests failed in CI.

              Please run the tests locally before reopening:

              ```bash
              ./gradlew clean test
              ```

              Typical fixes:
              - Re-run flaky tests locally multiple times.
              - Ensure any new code has deterministic tests.
              - Keep each test focused: "expected outcome, when setup condition".

              After fixing:
              1. Commit & push to the same branch.
              2. Re-open this PR.
              3. CI will run the tests again.

              If you believe this was closed in error, you can still reopen it manually.
